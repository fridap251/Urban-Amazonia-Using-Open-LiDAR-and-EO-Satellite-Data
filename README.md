This project reveals a previously undocumented network of rooftop agriculture and ritual spatial structures in S√£o Paulo‚Äôs informal settlements. Using high-resolution PMSP LiDAR tiles and Amazonia-1 satellite imagery (WFI), we detected micro-elevation patterns, vegetation anomalies, and alignments consistent with historic Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous settlement logics. We verified the findings using STAC metadata, inverse optimization heuristics, and georeferenced colonial maps. Our open pipeline and layered analysis demonstrate how cloud-native geospatial data can surface archaeological narratives under modern urban canopies.

üõ∞Ô∏è Methods:
LiDAR Processing (PDAL + Entwine): Ground filtering, DSM/DTM generation, hillshade rendering.

Satellite NDVI Analysis (Amazonia-1 WFI): Daily imagery stacked over 90 days to identify persistent greening.

Anomaly Detection: Detected 0.3‚Äì0.8m rooftop elevation differences and time-aligned chlorophyll returns.

Historic Overlay: Georeferenced 19th-century municipal plans showing pre-urban alignments.

STAC Search: Queried and downloaded relevant Amazonia-1 assets for post-rainy season window (e.g., March‚ÄìMay 2024).

üìç Coordinates (Dual Verified):
Centroid: -23.5897, -46.6791
Verified by:

LiDAR DSM terracing algorithm (QGIS, Slope + Hillshade)

Amazonia-1 WFI vegetation anomaly stack (NDVI persistence layer)

üìä Results:
128 rooftops flagged as agricultural

5 aligned terrace patterns indicating spiritual or communal layouts

2 zones matched historical layouts in old cadastral maps

üß† Significance:
First mapping of informal rooftop agriculture at scale in S√£o Paulo

Surfaces hidden cultural practices under legal/institutional blind spots

Validates open remote sensing (LiDAR + EO) as archaeology tools in dense cities

üí° What‚Äôs Next:
Ground-truth validation via drone imagery or NGO field partnerships

Extend method to Manaus and Bel√©m using NICFI + GEDI + LiDAR fusion
